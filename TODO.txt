Completed / Release Information
-------------------------------
v1.00
--------------
- Incorporate About dialog box
- Convert RAGenPDE to Tab
- Change output directory to be sketchfolder
- Add in current directory
- Update GetOutputFolder to be GetFolders
- Convert RAGenFeatures to Tab
	- Update output directory to be in libraries folder
- Incorporate Settings dialog box
- Improve Settings dialog box
	- Add arduino folder to settings box
- Create Internal Memory page to generate the default settings PDE file
- Process command line arguments (create them and have them be used)
	- these switches will override the registry settings (and currently replace 10-24-10)
	- /dev, /normal - application mode
	- /always, /never, /force - prompt to save settings
- Standard Libraries page added
	- Be only tab shown when in normal mode
	- Save state of ports (enabled/disabled, reset all)
	- Restore state of ports from saved (reset saved)
	- Generate PDE file
- Add in check for arduino.exe in arduino folder
- Add launch arduino command after generate PDE, Internal Memory & Std page
- Settings Page
	- Add in Always Launch, Prompt to Launch, Never Launch arduino after generate
	- Recheck for arduino.exe on folder change
	- Add in ability to set Development Mode/Libraries from Settings Page
- Have Launch button to launch arduino (PDE, Internal Memory, Standard pages)
	- only visible after a generate
	
v1.0.1
------
- Added true status bar
- Updated version string to be full version instead of shortened version
- Removed generate button from Features page
	- ReefAngel_Features.h is now generated when the PDE file is generated
- fixed a tab in generated PDE file, switched to spaces
- Added ability to customize libraries folder, searches default locations first
	- My Documents/Arduino/libraries
	- ARDUINO_PATH/libraries
	- lastly set to current directory
- Generate PDE generates features based on options selected on PDE page
- Remove features from features page that are not controlled by PDE page
- Hide Alternate Font check box, re-enable when alternate font is working
- Add in Controller detection code
- Add in Menu item for detection of controller
- Add in window to list all COM Ports on system and if RA Controller is connected

v1.0.2
------
- Fixed: if WM is set to always on and you disable and re-enable the wm, the spin box is re-enabled with the checkbox set
- Added additional XML data output for Dave's client
- Fixed: Added ReefAngel_Wifi.h include line to the dev PDE file being generated
- Added in RelayExp define for the expansion modules.  To use, you must manually edit the PDE file to reference the ports.
- Changed Send Parameters / Logging for Dave's client to PC
- Added Web logging for web banner creation.  Default interval of 5 seconds and Roberto's id and labels
