- Generate PDE generates features based on options selected on PDE page
	- no WM chosen, don't include
	- no DP chosen, don't include
	- if dual ato chosen, enable dual ato

v1.00
--------------
- Incorporate About dialog box
- Convert RAGenPDE to Tab
- Change output directory to be sketchfolder
- Add in current directory
- Update GetOutputFolder to be GetFolders
- Convert RAGenFeatures to Tab
	- Update output directory to be in libraries folder
- Incorporate Settings dialog box

	- Restore state of ports from saved (reset saved)
	- Generate PDE file
- Add in check for arduino.exe in arduino folder
- Add launch arduino command after generate PDE, Internal Memory & Std page
- Settings Page
	- Add in Always Launch, Prompt to Launch, Never Launch arduino after generate
	- Recheck for arduino.exe on folder change
	- Add in ability to set Development Mode/Libraries from Settings Page
- Have Launch button to launch arduino (PDE, Internal Memory, Standard pages)
	- only visible after a generate
	
v1.0.1
