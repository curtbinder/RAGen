- fixed a tab in generated PDE file, switched to spaces
- Added ability to customize libraries folder, searches default locations first
	- My Documents/Arduino/libraries
	- ARDUINO_PATH/libraries
	- lastly set to current directory
- Generate PDE generates features based on options selected on PDE page
- Remove features from features page that are not controlled by PDE page
- Hide Alternate Font check box, re-enable when alternate font is working
- Add in Controller detection code
- Add in Menu item for detection of controller
- Add in window to list all COM Ports on system and if RA Controller is connected

v1.0.2
------
- Fixed: if WM is set to always on and you disable and re-enable the wm, the spin box is re-enabled with the checkbox set
- Added additional XML data output for Dave's client
- Fixed: Added ReefAngel_Wifi.h include line to the dev PDE file being generated
- Added in RelayExp define for the expansion modules.  To use, you must manually edit the PDE file to reference the ports.
- Changed Send Parameters / Logging for Dave's client to PC
- Added Web logging for web banner creation.  Default interval of 180 seconds and Roberto's id and labels
- Added Web Banner customization dialog box, values always saved to registry and loaded from

v1.0.3
------
- Fix XML ATO Low & High switch reading for Dev libraries (0.8.5.11 or later) (Removed due to changes in libraries)
- Fix PC Logging to use new ReefAngel.PCLogging() function (0.8.5.12 or later)
	- function reads strings from PROGMEM instead of RAM
	- Not available in Standard libraries
- Migrate Web Logging to use ReefAngel.WebBanner() function (0.8.5.12 or later)
	- function reads strings from PROGMEM instead of RAM
- Fixed several Standard Library bugs
	- fixed menu_items variable
	- fixed interval setting for logging features (pc & web)
	- fixed MHlight define reference
	- fixed TimerClass data type for pc logging
- Added note in comments about WebBanner requiring 0.8.3.9 standard libraries

v1.0.3-static
------
- Static linking of libraries
- Minor fixes with changing tabs to spaces in PDE generation

v1.0.4
------
- Dosing Pump Repeat Interval internal memory values get set on Internal Memory page
	- Cannot change values currently (defaults to 60m)
	- Have to manually edit PDE file to use the Dosing Pump Repeat Interval
- Enabled features are now added to the PDE file comments for dev libraries
- PC Logging removed, logging data to the Client is not pushed, now it's always pulled
- Fixed bug with Reset->Logging not resetting the Web Banner value
- Added WifiAuthentication dialog box and PDE addition
- Add in DosingPumpIntervalSetup to Features page
	- When enabling, it overrides the standard dosing pump.  So all one needs to do is to enable it and then choose Dosing Pump and you are set.
- Fixed error with enabling / disabling PDE controlled features.  They were not being disabled after being enabled when you remove a device/feature.

v1.1.0
------
- Updated copyright year
